## ðŸ“– Project Overview

In an agriculture-dependent country like Bangladesh, cattle play a vital role in farming and meeting nutritional demands.  
Husks, the protective coverings of plants, are a key and easily available component of cattle feed.  
Understanding the nutritional content of different husk species is crucial for formulating balanced and cost-effective diets for livestock.

This project introduces **HuskNet**, a deep learning model designed to accurately classify eight common husk species found in Bangladesh.  
By leveraging computer vision, HuskNet aims to provide a data-driven approach to enhance cattle feed formulation, ultimately supporting more sustainable agricultural practices and improving livestock productivity.

## ðŸŒ¾ The BDHusk Dataset

The model was trained and evaluated on the **[BDHusk dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h754ntdtfx/1)**, which includes:

- **Content**: A comprehensive collection of images from eight different husk species commonly found in Bangladesh.
- **Classes (8 total)**:  
  - Rice Husk  
  - Corn Husk  
  - Wheat Husk  
  - Chickpea Husk  
  - Lentil Husk  
  - Soybean Husk  
  - Grass Pea Husk  
  - Field Pea Husk
- **Size**: 2400 total images (300 per class).
- **Origin**: Images were captured in the **Sirajganj district of Bangladesh** using mobile camera devices.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture: HuskNet

**HuskNet** is a deep learning model specifically tailored for this multi-class classification task.

- **Base Architecture**: Built on the powerful **ResNet50** architecture, utilizing transfer learning.
- **Modifications**:  
  - Output layer with **8 neurons** (one for each husk class).  
  - **Softmax activation function** for multi-class predictions.
